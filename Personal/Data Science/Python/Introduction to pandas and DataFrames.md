- Series vs DataFrame (1D vs 2D structures)
	- Pandas primarily works with DataFrames, which are two-dimensional labeled data structures with columns of potentially different types. think of it like a spreadsheet or SQL table.
	- Series are one-dimensional labeled arrays, similar to a single column in a DataFrame
