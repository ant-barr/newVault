Definition of Terms
Pitch
	pitch relates to the ===frequency or rate of vibration=== of a string, column of air, or other physical source. it refers to how ===high or low=== we can hear.
	single sound is called ===TONE=== ( what we hear ) or ===NOTE ===(what is written in a score).
		==**pitch = tone = note**== 
Loudness
	Loudness relates to ===how much energy an instrument created ===or how much air is displaced. The distance that the string covers with each oscillation (back and forth) is translated into loudness. The rate at which it oscillates.
Timbre
	Timbre ===distinguishes one instrument from another.=== it also refers to the type of sound (it is a consequence of the overtones) of the same instrument in different registers (mellow, sharp) and eventually the loudness or dynamics.
Tempo
	Tempo refers to the overall speed or pace of the piece:
		- ===How quickly or slowly it goes by.===
		- how fast or slow you can tap in time to a piece of music
	Tempo is a major factor in conveying emotion. pieces with fast tempo tend to be regarded as happy and songs with a slow tempo can be regarded as sad.
	 -Beat indicates the basic unit to measure time. it is connected to a regular pulsation.
	- Meter refers to the way in which pulses or beats are grouped together. Every musical system has a pattern of strong and weak beats.
		- ===Double-meter 2/4 - examples: Ray Charles - Hit the road jack Michael Jackson -Thriller
		- triple-meter 3/4 - examples: Waltz - Mancini - Breakfast at Tiffany
		- Quadruple-meter 4/4 - examples: Tchaikovsky - March from Nutcracker ballet
		- Quintuple-meter 5/5 - asymmetric very few examples: take 5 , mission impossible theme. "very unusual".===
Rhythm
	Rhythm is the element that ===organizes movement in time. ===it refers to duration of a series of notes and silences and how they group together into units. Rhythm describes the relationship between the length of one note and another.
Beat
	indicates the basic unit to measure time. it is connected to a regular pulsation
Meter
	refers to the way in which pulses or beats are grouped together. every musical system has a pattern of strong and weak beats.
Interval and chord
	An interval is the distance between two succisive pitches/tones
