Composition:
	A piece of music embodied in written form or the process by which composers create such pieces. in general, people making music follow a detailed and specific scenario. in western art music this scenario is conveyed in written form

When you think of music as a language its written form has only existed for 1000 years which in the scale of humanity is very small. before the written form of music, it was passed on by oral tradition. the process of writing music has fundamentally changed the way we live.

Pitch
	pitch relates to the ===frequency or rate of vibration=== of a string, column of air, or other physical source. it refers to how ===high or low=== we can hear.
	single sound is called ===TONE=== ( what we hear ) or ===NOTE ===(what is written in a score).
		==**pitch = tone = note**== 
Loudness
	Loudness relates to ===how much energy an instrument created ===or how much air is displaced. The distance that the string covers with each oscillation (back and forth) is translated into loudness. The rate at which it oscillates.
Timbre
	Timbre ===distinguishes one instrument from another.=== it also refers to the type of sound (it is a consequence of the overtones) of the same instrument in different registers (mellow, sharp) and eventually the loudness or dynamics.
Tempo
	Tempo refers to the overall speed or pace of the piece:
		- ===How quickly or slowly it goes by.===
		- how fast or slow you can tap in time to a piece of music
	Tempo is a major factor in conveying emotion. pieces with fast tempo tend to be regarded as happy and songs with a slow tempo can be regarded as sad.
	 -Beat indicates the basic unit to measure time. it is connected to a regular pulsation.
	- Meter refers to the way in which pulses or beats are grouped together. Every musical system has a pattern of strong and weak beats.
		- ===Double-meter 2/4 - examples: Ray Charles - Hit the road jack Michael Jackson -Thriller
		- triple-meter 3/4 - examples: Waltz - Mancini - Breakfast at Tiffany
		- Quadruple-meter 4/4 - examples: Tchaikovsky - March from Nutcracker ballet
		- Quintuple-meter 5/5 - asymmetric very few examples: take 5 , mission impossible theme. "very unusual".===
Rhythm
	Rhythm is the element that ===organizes movement in time. ===it refers to duration of a series of notes and silences and how they group together into units. Rhythm describes the relationship between the length of one note and another.
Beat
	indicates the basic unit to measure time. it is connected to a regular pulsation
Meter
	refers to the way in which pulses or beats are grouped together. every musical system has a pattern of strong and weak beats.
Interval and chord
	An interval is the distance between two successive pitches/tones
Harmony, Melody
	Harmony can mean simply a ==parallel melody ==or the clusters of notes
	that form a context and background on which melody rests.
	Harmony ===describes the movement and relationship between intervals and chords.=== (simultaneously sounded pitches/tones)
	===Melody is the most appealing element of music. it is a succession of single pitches/tones which create a musical line.=== Characteristics of melody are range, shape and the way it moves.
	To the linear movement of melody, harmony adds another dimension, depth.
Tone
	is the smallest unit in music
Figure
	represents the smallest cluster of successive tones 2-5 that convey a definitive musical impression. it can be compared to a small word (yes or no)
Motive
	represents a series of figures 2-4 or group of words
Phrase
	consists of two or three motives which create a complete musical idea. it denotes a unit of meaning within a larger structure at the end of which can be resting place or cadence which punctuates a phrase as a comma or period.
Sentence
	consists of two phrases: antecedent (question, half cadence) and consequent(answer, authentic cadence)

Musical Texture
- Monophony is a single voice texture without accompaniment
- Polyphony is many voices( two or more melodies at the same time) based on counterpoint (punctus contra punctum)
- Homophony - There is only one melody and everything else is an accompaniment
