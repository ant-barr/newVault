	https://openstax.org/books/college-algebra/pages/3-1-functions-and-function-notation
	**Learning Objectives**
	- Determine whether a relation represents a function
	- Find the value of a function
	- Determine whether a function is one to one
	- Use the vertical lines to identify functions
	- Graph the functions listed in the library of functions
$$
	{(a,3),(b,1),(b,3),(c,4),(D,5)}
$$
	Set of ordered pairs does not represent a function as there is an input value that corresponds with two output values

A relation is a set of ordered pairs. The set of the first components of each ordered pairs is called the **Domain**. The second component for each ordered pair is called the **Range**.

Example:

| Player         | Rank |
| -------------- | ---- |
| Babe Ruth      | 1    |
| Willie Mays    | 2    |
| Ty Cobb        | 3    |
| Walter Johnson | 4    |
| Hank Aaron     | 5    |
