	Max(0.001, n)
	Max(0.001, .0001) -> .001
	Max(0.001, n^(-10)) -> 0.001

Pooling
	Given a matrix or array, can we get the max value based on the (n x n) and stride.


2x2

|  9  |  4  |  3  |  7  |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|  2  |  5  |  6  |  1  |
|  8  |  7  |  0  | 10  |
|  6  |  8  |  7  |  5  |

stride = 4

|  9  |  4  |  3  |  7  |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
(1st row) Max value = 9
(2nd row) Max value = 6
(3rd row) Max value = 10
(4th row) Max value = 8

output

|  9  |

Gradient decent
	given an initial weight, the weight needs to approach the final point on the gradient ( parabola) the next weight is calculated by taking the starting weight plus or minus the learning rate.
