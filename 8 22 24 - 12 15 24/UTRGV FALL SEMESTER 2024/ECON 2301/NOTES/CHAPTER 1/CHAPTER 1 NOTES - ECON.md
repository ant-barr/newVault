 1.1
	===what is economics about?===
	what will your life be like in the year 2014 - 2024? what kind of job will you be working? How much will you learn after graduating? The answers to these questions have to do with economics
1.2
	A definition of Economics
	1.2a
		Goods and bads
		Economists talk about goods and bad's. A ===good ===is anything that ===gives a person utility. ==Computers, cars, watch, television, love, friendship. Goods can ===either be tangible or intangible.=== A bad is anything that gives disutility.
	1.2b
		Resources
		it takes resources to produce goods. economists divide resources into ===four broad categories===
		- ===Land=== - natural resources 
		- ===Labor=== - physical and mental talents
		- ===Capital=== - Factories, tools and machinery to further production
		- ===Entrepreneurship=== - talent for organizing resources
	1.2c
		Scarcity 
		- The condition of ==wants are greater than the limited resources===
	1.2d
		The counter intuitiveness of economics
		Scarcity is a fact of life, and does not inherently doom you to poverty. ===Scarcity can coexist with a wealthy society.=== Both poor and wealthy countries face scarcity, the difference between poverty and wealth are economic and political systems. ===Institutions matter. ===In Cuba the production of, and what type of goods are produced are predetermined by the government. In the united states. the market decides what goods are produced.
Part 1
	A ===Rationing Device is a means of deciding who gets what of available resources and goods.=== If there is a high demand for a good a rationing device is used to decide who gets it. ===Dollar price is an example of a rationing device.===
	Scarcity and competition
	competition exists in all forms of society, economists want to know  why it exists and what form it will take. 
	===First: the economist concludes that competition exists because of scarcity
	Second: the economists sees that the form is trying to get more of a rationing device. === ===Whatever the rationing device is more people will try to get it.===
1.3
	Key Concepts in Economics
	1.3a
		Opportunity Cost
		We must ==choose what wants we will satisfy== due to the limited amount of resources. This is called an ===opportunity cost===
	1.3b
		Opportunity Cost and Behavior
		Economists believe that ===a change in opportunity costs can change a persons behavior ===such as getting offered 70 dollars to skip a class.
	1.3c
		Benefits and Costs
		If we could eliminate air pollution completely should we do it? ===If yes then you're only focusing on the benefits ===of eliminating air pollution and benefiting public health. "Pollution Tomorrow" is to pass a law stating that anyone seen driving a car will be sentenced to 40 years in prison. Presto. Clean air. Someone might say "I want clean air but how will i get to work." This cost is something you have to consider when looking at opportunity.
	1.3d
		Decisions Made at the Margin
		It is late at night and you've already studied 3 hours. You look at the clock and contemplate studying another hour. How would you summarize your thinking process. What question do you ask yourself to decide to study another hour or not. 
			Perhaps without knowing it you are thinking in terms of the cost and benefits of further study. Studying an extra hour has costs too. ( you will get less sleep, you will have less time to watch tv) when deciding what to do, do you look at the total cost and the total benefits? or do you look at something less than the total cost.
		According to economists, ===for most decisions, you think in terms of additional or marginal costs and benefits== not total costs and benefits. Thats because most decisions deal with making a small or additional change.
				According to economists, when individuals make decisions by comparing marginal benefits to marginal costs they are making decisions at the margin. When deciding whether or not to work two hours overtime the economics professor makes a decision at the margin. If the marginal benefits are greater than the marginal costs, you obviously expect a net benefit to ordering the next hamburger, and therefore you order it. If, however the marginal benefits are less than the marginal costs, you obviously expect a net cost to ordering the next hamburger, and therefore you do not order another.
	1.3e
		Efficiency
		What is the right amount of time to study for a test? In economics, the right amount of anything is the optimal or efficient amount - ===the amount for which the marginal benefits equal the marginal costs.== Stated differently. you have achieved efficiency when the marginal benefits equal the marginal costs.
			Suppose you are studying for an economics test and the first hour the marginal benefits are greater than the marginal costs MB > MC.
			Given this condition you will certainly study for the first hour ==because it is worth it===: The additional benefits are greater than the additional costs: so there is a net benefit to studying. 
			Suppose for the second hour of studying the marginal benefits are still greater than the marginal costs MB(second hour) > MC(Second hour).
		you will study for the second hour because the additional benefits are still greater than the additional costs.
			The marginal benefit (MB) curve of studying is downward sloping because we have assumed that the benefits of studying for the first hour are greater than the benefits of studying for the second hour and so on. The marginal cost(MC) curve of studying is upward sloping because we assume that studying the second hour costs a person more ( in terms of goods forfeited) than the first. The third costs more than the second and so on.
		Maximizing net benefits
			Take another look at exhibit 2. suppose you had stopped studying after the first hour. Would you have given up anything? yes you would have given up the net benefits of studying longer. To illustrate notice that between the first and second hour, the marginal benefits curve lies above the marginal cost. This means that studying the second hour has a net benefit. but if you hadn't studied that second hour you would have given up the opportunity to collect those net benefits.
		We conclude that studying three hours(but not one more minute longer ) has maximized net benefits. In short efficiency, which is consistent with MB = MC, is also consistent with maximizing net benefits.
	1.3f
		Economics is about ===Incentives==
		==An incentive is something that encourages or motivates a person to undertake an action.==
		Often what motivates a person to undertake an action is the belief that by taking that action she can make herself better off
			For example, if we say that Jane has an incentive to study for the upcoming exam, we imply that by studying Jane can make herself better off, probably in terms of receiving a higher grade on the exam than if she didn't study.
		Incentives are closely related to benefits and costs. Individuals have an incentive to undertake actions for which the benefits are greater than the costs.
		Economists are interested in what motivates behavior. The general answer is that people do what they have an incentive to do. Economists then hunt for what an incentive is.
	1.3g
		===Unintended Effects=== 
		Economists think in terms of unintended effects. For example, Andres, 16 years old, currently works after school at a grocery store. He earns $6.50 an hour. suppose the state passes a law saying that the minimum wage is $9.50 an hour. The legislators intention in passing the law is to help people like Andres earn more income.
			will the $ 9.50 an hour have the intended effect? Perhaps not. The manager of the grocery store may not find it worthwhile to continue paying Andres if she has to pay him more.
		What does all this mean for you? You may be safer if you know that this unintended effect exists and you adjust accordingly. An unintended effect is a positive or negative outcome that was not anticipated
	1.3h
		Exchange
			===Exchange or trade is the giving up of one thing for something else.=== Economics is sometimes called " The science of exchange" because so much that is discussed in economics has to do with exchange.
		We start with a basic question: Why do people enter into exchanges?
		The answer is that they do so to make themselves better off. When a person voluntarily trades $100 for a jacket, she is saying,"I prefer to have the jacket instead of the $100," and of course the seller says the opposite. Through trade or exchange, each person gives up something he values less for something he values more.
1.4
	The Market and Government
	In recent years, major economic problems and issues have plagued the United States, such as:
		- Financial Problems in the banking sector.
		- The economic effects of falling real estate prices
		- Growing federal budget deficits.
		- Downgrading of the U.S. debt.
		- A fall in economic activity, as measured by the total output of goods and services produced in the country.
		- High unemployment.
		- The looming crisis in Social Security.
		- Health-care issues.
		- Issues related to climate change and the environment.
		- The proper role of monetary policy.
		- The proper role of government regulatory policy in the economy
		- And much more.
	When it comes to economic problems, the national debate usually proceeds along these lines:
		===- First the problem is identified and defined or described.
		- Second, individuals attempt to identify the cause of the problem.
		- Third, individuals propose solutions to the problem.===
	With respect to both the cause and solution , we often hear two words mentioned: the "market" and "government".
		-Either: the market (or capitalism) is the cause of the problem
		-or: the government is the cause of the problem
		-Either : the market (or capitalism the solution to the problem
		-or: the government is the solution to the problem
1.5
	Ceteris Paribus
	A latin term meaning "all other things constant" or "nothing else changes."
		ceteris paribus
	1.5b
		Theory
		Economists build theories to answer questions that do not have obvious answers. Cause and effect.
		Abstract
		
1.6
	Economic Categories: (positive vs. Normative Economics)
	1.6a
		Positive - The study of "what is" in economic matters.
		Normative - The study of "what should be" in economic matters
	1.6b
	Microeconomics and Macroeconomics
		The tools of microeconomics are microscopes, and the tools of macroeconomics are telescopes. Macroeconomics stands back from the trees to see the forest. Microeconomics gets up close and examines the tree itself, its bark its libs and its roots. Microeconomics is the branch of economics that deals with human behavior and choices as they relate to relatively small units: an individual, a firm an industry.
		Macroeconomics is the brand of economics that deals with human behavior and choices as they relate to the entire economy
		Microeconomists might be indterested in
		- How does a market work?
		- What level of output does a firm produce?
		- What price does a firm change for the good it produces?
		on the other hand, a macroeconomists might be interested in
		- How does the economy work
		- Why is the unemployment rate sometimes high and sometimes low?
		- What causes inflation?
		- Why do some national economies grow faster than others?
		- How do changes in the money supply affect the economy?
		- How do changes in government spending and taxes affect the economy?
