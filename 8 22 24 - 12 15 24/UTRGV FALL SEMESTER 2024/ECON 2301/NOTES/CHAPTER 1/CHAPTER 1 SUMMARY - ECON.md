Goods, Bad's and Resources
- A good is anything that gives a person utility or satisfaction.
- A bad is anything that gives a person disutility or dissatisfaction
- Economists divide resources into four categories: land, labor, capital, and entrepreneurship.
- Land includes natural resources, such as materials, forests, water, and unimproved land.
- Labor refers to the physical and mental talents that people contribute to the production process.
- Capital consists of produced goods that can be used as inputs for further production, such as machinery, tools, computers, trucks, buildings and factories.
- Entrepreneurship refers to the talent that some people have for organizing the resources of land, labor and capital to produce goods, seek new business opportunities and develop new ways of doing things.

Scarcity
- Scarcity is the condition in which our wants are greater than the limited resources available to satisfy them.
- Scarcity implies choice. In a world of limited resources, we must choose which wants will be satisfied and which will go unsatisfied.
- Because of scarcity, there is a need for rationing device. A rationing device is a means of deciding who gets what quantities of the available resources and goods
- Scarcity implies competition. If resources were ample enough to satisfy all our seemingly unlimited wants, people would not have to compete for the available but limited resources.

Opportunity Cost
- Every time a person makes a choice, he or she incurs an opportunity cost. Opportunity cost is the most highly valued opportunity or alternative forfeited when a choice is made. the higher opportunity cost of doing something is, the less likely it will be done

Cost and Benefits
- What distinguishes the economist from the non-economist is that the economist thinks in therms of both costs and benefits. Asked what the benefits of taking a walk may be, an economist will also mention the related cost. Asked what the costs of studying are, an economist will also point out the benefits.

Decisions Made at the Margin
- Marginal benefits and costs are not the same as total benefits and costs. When deciding whether to talk on the phone one more minute, an individual would not consider the total benefits and total costs of speaking on the phone. Instead the person would compare only the marginal benefits ( additional benefits) of talking on the phone one more minute to the marginal costs ( additional costs) of doing so.

Incentives
- An incentive is something that encourages or motivates a person to undertake an action. Incentives are closely related to benefits and costs. Individuals have an incentive to undertake actions for which the benefits are greater than the costs or, stated differently, for which they expect to receive some net benefits (benefits greater than the costs).

Efficiency
- As long as the marginal benefits of an activity are greater than its marginal costs, a person gains by continuing to do the activity- whether the activity is studying, running, eating, or watching television. The net benefits of an activity are maximized when the marginal benefits of the activity equal its marginal costs. Efficiency exists at this point.

Unintended Effects
- Economists often think in terms of cause and effects. Effects may be both intended and unintended. Economists want to denote both types of effects when speaking of effects in general.

Exchange
- Exchange, or trade, is the process of giving up one thing for something else. People enter into exchanges to make themselves better off.

Ceteris Paribus
- Ceteris paribus is a Latin term that means "all other things constant" or "nothing else changes." ceteris paribus is used to designate what we believe is the correct relationship between two variable.

The market and the Government
- When it comes to economic problems and issues, we often see the following three-step process: 1. The problem is identified, then it is defined or described, 2. Next, the cause of the problem are identified, 3. Finally, proposed solutions to the problem are put forth. With respect to both the causes of the problem and the proposed solutions to the problem, we often hear individuals speaking about the market and the government is the cause of the problem. Similarly, opinions differ as to whether the market or the government is the solution to the problem. Much of this text will focus on the market-versus- government debat that lies beneath the surface of many economic problems and issues.

Theory
- Economists build theories to explain and predict real-world events. Theories are necessarily abstractions form, as opposed to the descriptions of, the real world.
- All theories abstract from reality; they focus on the critical variables that the theorist believes explain and predict the phenomenon in questions

Economic Categories
- Positive economics attempts to determine what is; normative economics adresses what should be.
- Microeconomics deals with human behavior and choices as they relate to relatively small unites while Macroeconomics deals with human behavior and choices as they relate to an entire economy.
