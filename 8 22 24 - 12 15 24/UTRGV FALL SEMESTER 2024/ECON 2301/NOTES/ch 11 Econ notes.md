11.1
The Federal Budget
	The federal budget has two, not necessarily equal, parts: government expenditures and tax revenues. government spending is not the same as government purchases. Government expenditures are the sum of government purchases and government transfer payments

11.1a
Government Expenditures
	In 2011, the federal government spent $3.603 trillion, which was 24.1 percent of GDP for that year. The following table shows government spending as a percentage of GDP in other years

| year | Government Spending as a percentage of GDP (%) |
| :--: | :--------------------------------------------: |

| 2014 |                      22.6                      |
	The bulk of the $3.603 trillion in government spending in 2011 was spent on four programs: national defense, social security, Medicare, and Medicaid. These four programs together accounted for about 65 percent of all government spending that year.

11.1b
Government Tax Revenues
	The federal government imposes taxes and fees that generate revenue. In 2011, government revenues totaled $2.303 trillion. This was 15.4 percent of GDP for the year. The following table shows government tax revenues as a percentage of GDP in other years (2012-2014 percentages are estimates):

| Year | Government Tax Revenues as a Percentage of GDP |
| :--: | :--------------------------------------------: |
| 2000 |                      20.6                      |
| 2001 |                      19.5                      |

| 2012 |                      15.4                      |
| 2013 |                      15.8                      |
| 2014 |                      17.8                      |
| 2015 |                      18.7                      |
The bulk of government tax revenues comes from three taxes:
- Individual income tax
- Corporate income tax
- Social Security taxes
	three taxes accounted for 91 percent of total government tax revenues;
	the income tax by itself accounted for 47.4 percent of total government revenues.

11.1c
Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid in the Future
	Tax revenues in the last 50 years as a percentage of the GDP have being in the 15-19 percent range.
	Suppose this continues. in 2050 - 19 tax revenue rate from GDP. What will all the tax revenues go for? 
		They will have to go for the sum of spending on just three federal government programs-Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid- because spending on these three programs is projected to be approximately 19 percent in 2050. There will be no money left for national defense, education, infrastructure, education, and so on. To the degree that federal government will do other things in 2050 than support these programs, all the monies used to support other programs will have to be borrowed.

Income Tax Structures
- Progressive income tax:
	The tax rate increases as a persons taxable income level rises. Suppose Davidson pays taxes at the rate of 15 percent on a taxable income of $20,000. When his (taxable) income rises to, say, $30,000, he pays at a rate of 28 percent. And when his income rises to, say, $55,000, he pays at a rate of 31 percent. A progressive income tax is usually capped. Currently, the US income tax structure is progressive, with six(marginal) tax rates, ranging (in 2009) from a low of 10 percent to a high of 35 percent.
- proportional income tax:
	The same rate is used for all income levels. A proportional income tax is sometimes referred to as a flat tax: For example, Kuan pays taxes at a rate of 10 percent whether her taxable income is $10,000 or $100,000.
- Regressive income tax:
	The tax rate decreases as a persons taxable income level rises. For example, Lowensteins tax rate is 10 percent when her taxable income is $10,000 and 8 percent when her taxable income rises to $20,000.

Who Pays the Income Tax?
	income tax by income group, share of total income, share of federal income taxes, income split point (tax bracket)

| Income Group | Groups Share of Total income | Groups Share of Federal Income Taxes |  Income Split Point   |
| :----------: | :--------------------------: | :----------------------------------: | :-------------------: |
|    Top 1%    |             16.9             |                 36.7                 | Greater than $343,923 |
|    Top 5%    |             31.7             |                 58.7                 | Greater than $154,643 |
|   Top 10%    |             43.2             |                 70.5                 | Greater than $112,224 |
|   Top 25%    |             65.8             |                 87.3                 | Greater than $66,193  |

11.1e
Budget Deficit, Surplus, or Balance
	The government budget can be in one of three states
- If government expenditures are greater than tax revenues, the federal government runs a budget deficit
- If tax revenues are greater than government expenditures, the federal government runs a budget surplus.
- If government expenditures equal tax revenues, the federal government runs a balanced budget.

Projected budget deficit 2012-2016

| Year | Deficit ($ billions) | Deficit as a Percentage of GDP (%) |
|:----:|:--------------------:|:----------------------------------:|
| 2012 |        1,171         |                7.6                 |
| 2013 |         612          |                3.8                 |
| 2014 |         385          |                2.3                 |
| 2015 |         257          |                1.5                 |
| 2016 |         259          |                1.4                 |
	If the government spends more than its tax revenue and thus runs a budget deficit, where does it get the money to finance the deficit? For example, if the government spends $100 and has $70 only in taxes, where does it get the $30 difference? The federal government-actually the US Treasury - borrows the $30; that is, it finances the budget deficit with borrowed funds.

11.1f
Structural and Cyclical Deficits
- Cyclical Deficit: to describe the part of the budget deficit that is a result of a downturn in economic activity. The remainder of the deficit-the part that would exist if the economy were operating at full employment- is called the structural deficit.
	
	(Total budget deficit = Structural deficit + Cyclical deficit)

11.1g
The public Debt
	Government expenditures are greater than tax revenues for a single year. The public debt, sometimes called federal or national debt, is the total amount the federal government owes its creditors. Some of this debt is held by agencies of the united states government; that is, one entity in the government owes it to another. The remainder of the debt is held by the public and is referred to either as public debt held by the public or as net public debt.

11.1h
Value-Added Tax
	Some persons have proposed higher taxes or new taxes to deal with the enlarged budget deficits and growing public debt. One tax that has been suggested is the value-added tax (VAT). Some have proposed VAT as a supplementary revenue source; others as a substitute for current taxes.
		There are two things to understand about a value-added tax: the value-added part and the tax part

- The value added part: The difference between what a producer sells a final good for and what it pays for an intermediate good. For example, suppose a farmer finds a seed and plants it. In time, wheat appears. The farmer harvests the wheat and sells it to a baker for $1. The value added is $1.00.
	- The farmer sells the wheat to the baker for $1.00
	- The farmer doesn't buy any intermediate goods( intermediate goods purchased = $0.00)
	- Value added = $1.00 - $0.00 = $1.00
	- dollar amount kept by farmer = $1.00
- The baker who has purchased the wheat, turns it into a loaf of bread, which he sells to a final consumer for $1.40. The value added is $0.40
	- The baker sells the loaf of bread to a consumer for $1.40
	- The baker bought the wheat (intermediate good) from the farmer for $1.00
	- Value added = $1.40 - $1.00 = $0.40
	- Dollar amount kept by baker = $0.40
1. The sum of the value added ($1.00 + $0.40) is equal to the price paid by the final consumer for the loaf of bread ($1.40).
2. The value added at each stage of production is equal to the dollar amount kept by the farmer and baker. For instance, the value added by the farmer was $1.00, and this is the amount he kept.

- The tax part: VAT is a tax applied to the value added at each stage of production. Suppose the VAT rate is 10 percent. A VAT rate of 10 percent is applied to the $1.00 value added by the farmer is $0.10. A VAT tax rate of 10 percent applied to the $0.40 value added by the baker is $0.04. The total VAT ends up being $0.14

|      What value was added and who was taxed      | Value added and taxed |
| :----------------------------------------------: | :-------------------: |
|               Value added by famer               |         $1.00         |
| VAT rate of 10% applied to value added by farmer |         $0.10         |
|               Value added by baker               |         $0.40         |
| VAT rate of 10% applied to value added by baker  |         $0.04         |
|            Total VAT = $0.10 + $0.04             |         $0.14         |
- To see how the $0.14 ends up with government, we need to revisit our farmer-baker example, but this time with a VAT applied. Initially, the farmer charges the baker $1.00 for wheat. This time with a VAT tax rate of 10 percent, he charges the baker 10 percent more, or $1.10, for the wheat. Here is how things now look for the farmer
	- The farmer sells the what to the baker for $1.10.
	- The farmer turns over $0.10 to the government ( this is the VAT at the farmers stage of production).
	- The farmer keeps $1.00 which is the amount he kept when there was no vat.
- Whereas the baker sold a loaf of bread to the consumer for $1.40, this time, with a Vat rate of 10 percent, he charges 10 percent more or $1.54, for a loaf of bread.. Here is how things now look for the baker:
	- The baker sells the loaf of bread to the consumer for $1.54
	- The baker paid $1.10 for the wheat
	- The baker turns over $.04 to government (VAT at the bakers stage of production).
	- The baker keeps $1.54 minus $1.10 (What he paid for the wheat) minus $0.04(what he turns over to the government) or $0.40, which is what he kept when there was no VAT.
- Finally here are how things look for the consumer and government
	- Without VAT, the consumer paid $1.40 for a loaf of bread. With VAT, she pays $1.54.
	- Without VAT, government collected no VAT revenues. With VAT, government collects $0.14 in VAT revenue.
So, the VAT (1) generates tax revenue and (2) raises prices

Vat compared to a sales tax: The VAT is nothing more than a less visible sales tax.

11.1i
Tax Deductions Versus Subsidies
	Subsidy is different from tax deduction. With a subsidy, money goes from one person to another. Money comes from smith and goes to jones. With a tax deduction it doesn't. If company X is being subsidized, government is essentially taking money from taxpayers and handing it over to company X. With a tax deduction. Government reduces its taxes by a dollar amount for some kind of incentive ( stying in America)

11.2
Fiscal Policy
	Changes in government expenditures and/or taxes to achieve economic goals, such as low unemployment, stable prices, and economic growth

11.2a
Some Relevant Fiscal Policy Terms
- Expansionary Fiscal Policy: Government expenditures are up and/or taxes are down
- Contractionary Fiscal Policy: Government expenditures are down and/or taxes are up.
- Discretionary Fiscal Policy: Deliberate changes of government expenditures and/or taxes to achieve economic goals
- Automatic Fiscal Policy: Changes in government expenditures and/or taxes that occur automatically without (additional) congressional action.

11.2b
Two Important Notes
- Keep in mind the following two important points:
	- We deal with only discretionary fiscal policy. Deliberate actions on the part of policy makers to affect the economy through changes in government spending and/or taxes
	- We assume that any change in government spending is due to a change in government purchases, not to a change in transfer payments. In other words we assume that transfer payments are constant so that changes in government spending are a reflection only of changes in government purchases.

---

11.3
Demand-Side Fiscal Policy
	How government spending and taxes-fiscal policy- can affect the demand side of the economy, that is, aggregate demand.

11.3a
Shifting the Aggregate Demand Curve
	How do changes in government purchases (G) and taxes (T) affect aggregate demand? Recall that a change in consumption, investment, government purchases, or net exports can change aggregate demand and therefore shift the AD curve.

11.3b
Fiscal Policy: Keynesian Perspective (Economy is Not Self-Regulating)
	The model of the economy shows downward-sloping AD curve and an upward sloping SRAS curve. when the economy is in a recessionary gap. Aggregate demand is too low to move the economy to equilibrium at the Natural Real GDP level. The Keynesian perspective of the economy is that the economy is not self regulating so the prescription is to enact expansionary fiscal policy measures. (increase in government purchase and/or decrease in taxes) to shift the aggregate demand curve rightward. and to move the Natural Real GDP level.

11.3c
Crowding Out: Questioning Expansionary Fiscal Policy
	Crowding Out: the decrease in private expenditures that occurs as a consequence of increased government spending or the financing needs of a budget deficit
- consider these two examples
	- Direct Effect. The government spends more on public libraries, and individuals buy fewer books at a bookstore 
	- Indirect Effect. The government spends more on social programs and defense without increasing taxes; as a result, the size of the budget deficit increases. Consequently, the government must borrow more funds to finance the larger deficit. The increase in borrowing causes the demand for credit ( the demand for loanable funds) to rise, which in turn causes the interest rate to rise. As a result, investment drops. More government spending indirectly leads to less investment spending.
Types of crowding out
- Complete crowding out: A decrease in one or more components of private spending that completely offsets the increase in government spending.
- Incomplete crowding out: The decrease in one or more components of private spending that only partially offsets the increase in government spending.

11.3d
Lags and Fiscal Policy
- Even if there is zero crowding out, should fiscal policy then be used to solve the problems of inflationary and recessionary gaps? Many economists answer not necessarily, because of lags. there are five types of lags:
	- The data lag. Policy makers are not aware of changes in the economy as soon as they happen. For example if the economy turns down in January, the decline may not be apparent for two to three months.
	- The wait-and-see lag. After policy makers are ware of a downturn in economic activity, they rarely enact counteractive measures immediately. Instead, they usually adopt a relatively cautious wait-and-see attitude to be sure that the observed events are not just short-run phenomena.
	- The legislative lag. After policy makers decide that some type of fiscal policy measure is required, congress or the president has to propose the measure, build political support for it, and get it passed. The legislative lag can take many months
	- The transmission lag. Once enacted a fiscal policy measure takes time to go into effect. For example, a discretionary expansionary fiscal policy measure mandating increased spending for pubic works projects requires construction companies to submit bids for the work, prepare designs, and negotiate contracts, and so on.
	- The effectiveness log. After being actually implemented, a policy measure takes time to affect the economy. If government spending is increased on Mondays, the aggregate demand curve does not shift rightward on Tuesday.

11.3e
Crowding out, lags, and the effectiveness of fiscal policy
	Economists who believe that crowding out is zero and that lags are insignificant conclude that fiscal policy is effective at moving the economy out of a recessionary gap. Economists who believe that crowding out is complete and/or that lags are significant conclude that fiscal policy is ineffective in this respect

---

11.4
Supply-Side Fiscal Policy
	Fiscal policy effects may be felt on the supply side as well as on the demand side of the economy. For example, a reduction in tax rates may alter an individuals incentive to work and produce, thus altering aggregate supply.

11.4a
Marginal Tax Rates and Aggregate Supply
	When fiscal policy measures affect tax rates, they may affect both aggregate supply and aggregate demand. Consider a reduction in an individuals marginal tax rate.
		Marginal (income) tax rate: The change in a persons tax payment divided by the change in taxable income Tax payment / Taxable income
	A cut in marginal tax rates increases the attractiveness of productive activity relative to leisure and tax-avoidance activities and shifts resources from the latter to the former, thus shifting rightward both the short-run and long-run aggregate supply curve.

11.4b
The Laffer Curve: Tax Rates and Tax Revenues
	High tax rates are followed by attempts of ingenious men to beat them as surely as snow is followed by little boys on sleds
	- Arthur Okun, economist (1928-1980)
		If marginal income tax rates are reduced, will income tax revenues increase or decrease? Most people think the answer is obvious. Lower tax rates mean lower tax revenues. Economist Arthur Laffer explained why this may not be the case. As the story is told, Laffer, while dining with a journalist drew the Laffer curve on a napkin. Laffer's objective was to explain the possible relationships between tax rates and tax revenues. Tx revenues are on the vertical axis and tax rates are on the horizontal axis. Laffer made three major points about the curve:
1. Zero tax revenues will be collected at two (marginal) tax rates: 0 percent and 100 percent. Obviously, no tax revenues will be raised if the tax rate is zero, and if the tax rate is 100 percent, no one will work and earn income because the entire amount will be taxed away.
2. An increase in tax rates could cause tax revenues to increase. For example an increase in tax rates from X percent to Y percent will increase tax revenues from Tx to Ty.
3. A decrease in tax rates could cause tax revenues to increase. For example a decrease in tax rates from Z percent to Y percent will increase tax revenues from Tz to Ty. This point brought public attention to the Laffer curve
Both an increase and a decrease in tax rates at different times can increase tax revenues due to the interrelationships among tax rates, the tax base, and tax revenues. Tax revenues equal the tax base times the (average) tax rate.
		Tax revenues = Tax base x (average) Tax rate

Fiscal Policy and Expectations
	Even if tax rates are lowered, people do not work more and produce more, it cannot necessarily be said that lower tax rates do not stimulate work and production. Consider two different settings
- Setting 1 income tax rates are lowered in year 1 with no further cuts expected in future years
- Setting 2, income tax rates are lowered in year 1 with further cuts expected in future years.
	Suppose tax cuts are implemented in setting 1. and individuals don't respond by working more and producing more.
