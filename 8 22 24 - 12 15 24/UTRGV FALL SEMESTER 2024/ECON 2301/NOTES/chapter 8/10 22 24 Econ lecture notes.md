**Aggregate Demand and Aggregate Supply**
	Why is the demand curve downward sloping?




**International Trade Effect**
	The change in foreign sector spending as the price level changes
- Price level in the us falls relative to foreign price levels => U.S. goods relatively less expensive than foreign goods => both Americans and foreigners buy more U.S. goods.
- price level in the U.S. rises relative to foreign price levels => U.S. goods relatively more expensive than foreign goods => both Americans and foreigners buy fewer U.S. goods.


**Change in aggregate Demand**
	GDP = ===C ===+ I +G+(X-M)
Due to ==consumption==
- wealth
- price
- income
- interest rate
- income tax

**Factors that change aggregate demand and consumptions due to ===wealth===***
- wealth increases, consumption increases, aggregate demand increases
- wealth decreases, consumption decreases, aggregate demand decreases
**Factors that change Aggregate Demand and Consumption due to ===Prices===**
- Expect higher future prices consumption goes up and aggregate demand increases
- Expect lower future prices consumption goes down and aggregate demand decreases
**Factors that change Aggregate Demand and Consumption due to ===Income===**
- Expect Higher future income, consumption goes up, demand goes up
- Expect Lower future income, consumption goes down, aggregate demand goes down
**Factors that change Aggregate Demand and consumption due to ===interest rate===**
- Interest rate goes up, consumption goes down ,aggregate demand goes down
- interest rates goes down, consumption goes up, aggregate demand goes up
**Factors that change Aggregate Demand and Consumption due to ===Income Taxes===
- Income taxes goes up consumption goes down aggregate demand goes down
- Income taxes goes down consumption goes up aggregate demand goes up

Factors that change aggregate demand
	due to ===investment===: GDP= C+ ===I ===+ G + (X-M)
- interset rates
- future sales
- business taxes

***Factors that change aggregate demand and investment due to ===interest rates===***
- Interest rates increase, investments decrease, aggregate demand decreases
- Interest rates decrease, investments increase, aggregate demand increases
***Factors that change aggregate demand and investments/ ===future sales===***
- Optimistic about future sales, investments increase, aggregate demand increases
- Pessimistic about future sales, investments decrease, aggregate demand decreases
***Factors that change investment/expectations about ===future sales===***
	Businesses invest because they expect to sell the goods they produce
- optimistic, investments increase, aggregate demand increase
- pessimistic, investments decrease aggregate demand decrease
	if businesses become optimistic about future sales, , investment spending grows and aggregate demand increases.
	if businesses become pessimistic about future sales investment spending contracts and aggregate demand decreases
***Factors that change aggregate demand and investment/ ===business taxes***
- business taxes goes down, investment increases, aggregate demand increases
- business taxes goes up, investment contracts, aggregate demand decreases
***Factors that change investments/business taxes***
	businesses naturally consider expected after-tax profits when making their investment decisions
- business taxes increase, investments contracts, aggregate demand decreases
- business taxes decrease, investments increase, aggregate demand increases
	An increase in business taxes lowers expected profitability. with less profit expected, businesses invest less. as investment spending declines so does aggregate demand.
	a decrease in business taxes on the other hand raises expected probability and investments spending this increases aggregate demand.
