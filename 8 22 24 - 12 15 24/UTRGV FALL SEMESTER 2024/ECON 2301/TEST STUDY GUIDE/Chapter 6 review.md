Price and Unemployment

6.1
Measuring the Price Level
	There is a difference between price and the price level. The word price referes to a single price, such as the price of apples or the price of oranges.
	Price level is a weighted average of the prices of all goods and services. The key phrase in that definition is "a weighted average of all prices.
	Heres a rough way of thinking about a price level.
	Suppose an economy consists of three goods: apples, oranges and pears. The prices of apples, oranges, and pears, respectively, are 50, 60, and 80 cents, respectively. The average price (of these three goods) is 63 cents. That is also the price level.

6.1a
Computing the Price Level using the CPI
	Economists measure the price level by constructing a price index. One major price index is the Consumer price index (CPI). The CPI is based on a representative group of goods and services, called the market basket, purchased by a typical household the market basket includes eight major categories of goods and services: 1: food and beverages, 2: housing, 3: apparel, 4: transportation, 5: medical care, 6: recreation, 7: education and communication, and 8: other goods and services
		to simplify, we assume the market basket includes only three goods. our market basket consists of 10 pens, 5 shirts, and 3 pairs of shoes.
	To calculate the CPI, First calculate the total dollar expenditure on the market basket in two years: the current year and the base year. The base year is a benchmark year that serves as a basis of comparison for prices in other years.
		In exhibit 1, we multiply the quantity of each good in the market basket colum 1 by its current year price 9column 2) to compute the current year expenditure on each good (column 3) by adding the dollar amounts in column 3, we obtain the total dollar expenditure on the market basket in the current year. This amount is $167.
	To find the total expenditure on the market basket in the base year, we mulitply the quantity of each good in the market basket (column 1A) by its base year price (column 2A) and then add these products (column 3A). This gives us $67.


| Market Basket (1)        | Current-Year Prices (2) | Current-Year Expenditures (3A) | Market Basket (1A)                    | Base-year Prices (2A) | Base-Year Expenditures (3A) |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------------- |
| 10 pens                  | x $.70                  | = $7.00                        | 10 pens                               | x $.20                | = $2.00                     |
| 5 shirts                 | x $14.00                | = $70.00                       | 5 shirts                              | x $7.00               | = $35.00                    |
| 3 pairs of sheos         | x $30.00                | = $90.00                       | 3 pairs of shoes                      | x$10.00               | = $30.00                    |
| Total dollar expenditure |                         | $167.00                        | total dollar expenditure in base year |                       | $67.00                      |
CPI = (Total dollar expenditure on market basket in current year/Total dollar expenditure on market basket in base year) x 100
= ($167/$67) x 100
= 249

When we know the CPI for Various years, we can compute the Percentage Change in Prices To find the percentage change in prices between any two years, use the following formula:
PCP=(CPI later year - CPI earlier year / CPI earlier year) x 100
	For example the CPI in 1990 was 130.7 and that the CPI in 2005 was 195.3. The percentage change in price over this period of time was 49.43 percent

6.1b
Inflation and the CPI
	Inflations is an increase in the price level and is usually measured on an annual basis. The inflation rate is the positive percentage change in the price level on an annual basis.
		when you know the inflation rate you can find out weather your income is keeping up with, not keeping up with, or more than keeping up with inflation. How you are doing depends on whether your income is rising by, the same percentage as, or smaller percentage than, or a greater percentage than the inflation rate. When you make this kind of computation you are determining your real income for different years.
	Real income is a persons nominal income or (current dollar amoount of income) adjusted for any change in prices.
	Real income is computed as follows:
	RI = (Nominal income/CPI) x 100

Case 1. Keeping up with Infation: Real Income stays constant
	Jim earns $50,000 in year 1 and $55,00- in year 2. The CPI is 100 in year 1 and 110 in year 2; so the inflation rate is 10 percent: (110-100/100) x 100 = 10. Jims income has risen by 10 percent. (55,000 - 50,000/50,000) x 100 = 10. So jims income is the same as the inflation rate; so he has kept up with inflation. This is evident when we see that Jims real income is the same in both years
		Real income year 1 = (50,000/100) x 100 = 50,000
		Real income year 2 = (55,000/110) x 100 = 50,000

Case 2. Not keeping up with inflation: Real Income Falls
	Karen earns $50,000 in year 1 and $52,000 in year 2. The CPI is 100 in year 1 and 110 in year 2. Karen’s income has risen by 4 percent, and the inflation rate is 10 percent. Her income has risen by a smaller percentage than the inflation rate; so she has not kept up with inflation. Karen’s real income has fallen from $50,000 in year 1 to $47,273 in year 2.
		Real income year 1 = (50,000/100) x 100 = 50,000
		Real income year 2 = (52,000/110) x 100 = 47,273

Case 3. More than keeping up with inflation: Real Income Rises
	Carl earns $50,000 in year 1 and $60,000 in year 2. The CPI is 100 in year 1 and 110 in year 2. Carl’s income has risen by 20 percent, and the inflation rate is 10 percent. His income has risen by a greater percentage than the inflation rate; so he has more than kept up with inflation. Carl’s real income has risen from $50,000 in year 1 to $54,545 in year 2
		Real income year 1 = (50,000/100) x100 = 50,000
		Real income year 2 = (60,000/110) x 100 - 54,545

6.1c 
GDP implicit Price Deflator
	besides the CPI, another price index is often cited: the GDP deflator or the Gdp implicit price deflator. Obviously, an economy produces more goods and services than find their way into the CPIs representative market basket. The GDP implicit price deflator, unlike the CPI, is based on all goods and services produced in an economy.

6.1d
Converting Dollars from One Year to Another
	suppose someone says, "Back in 1960, I had an annual salary of $10,000 a year. that sure isnt much these days."
	Of course, the person is right in one sense: An annual salary of 10,000 doesnt buy much these days, but was it a good salary back in 1960? it certainly could have been, because prices in 1960 werent as high as they are today. For example, the CPI was 29.6 in 1960 and 224.939 in 2011. In other words, one of the things that make a salry good or not so good is what the salary can buy. Now suppose someone tells you that a 10,000 salaray in 1960 is the same as 75,992 salary today. Would you then be better able to say whether the 1960 - 10,000 salary was good or not so good? Of course you would because you understand what it means to earn 75,992 today. Economists convert a past salary into todays salary by using this formula:
		Salary in current dollars = Salary earlier year x (CPI current year / CPI earlier year)
	Assume the CPI today is the same as the most recent CPI in Exhibit 3 (which is the CPI for 2011). Using the formula, we get:
		Salary in 2011 dollars = 10,000 x (224.939/29.6) = 75,992

Measuring Unemployment
	Every month, the government surveys thousands of households to gather information about labor market activities. It uses the information from the survey to derive the number of Americans unemployed.

6.2a
Who Are the Unemployed?
	The total population of the United States can be divided into two broad groups (Exhibit 4) One group consists of persons who are (1) under 16 years of age, (2) in the armed forces, or (3) institutionalized (in a prison, mental institution, or home for the aged). The second group, which consist of all others in the total population, is called the civilian non-institutional population.
		The civilian non-institutional population, in turn, can be divided into two groups: persons not in the labor force and persons in the civilian labor force. (Economists often refer to this group as the labor force instead of the civilian labor force.)
	Civilian non-institutional pop = Persons not in the labor force + Civilian Labor Force
- Persons not in the labor force are neither working nor looking for work. In this category, for example, are people who are retired, who are engaged in own-home housework, or who choose not to work.
- Persons in the civilian labor force fall into one of two categories: employed or unemployed
	Civilian labor force = Employed persons + Unemployed persons

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), employed persons consists of:
- All persons who did any work for pay or profit during the survey reference week.
- All persons who did at least 15 hours of unpaid work in a family-operated enterprise.
- All persons who were temporarily absent for their regular jobs because of illness, vacation, bad weather, industrial dispute, or various personal reasons.

According to the BLS, unemployed persons consists of:
- All persons who did not have jobs, who made specific active efforts to find a job during the prior four weeks, and who were available for work.
- All persons who were not working and who were waiting to be called back to a job from which they had been temporarily laid off.

6.2b
The Unemployment and Employment Rates
	The unemployment rate is the percentage of the civilian labor force that is unemployed. It is equal to the number of unemployed persons divided by the civilian labor force
		Unemployment rate (U) = (Number of unemployed/Civilian labor force)
	The employment rate ( sometimes referred to as the employment/population ratio) is the percentage of the civilian non-institutional population that is employed. It is equal to the number employed persons divided by the civilian non-institutional population: 
		Employment Rate (E) = (Number of employed persons/Civilian non-institutional population)
	Finally, the labor force participation rate (LFPR) is the percentage of the civilian non-institutional population that is in the civilian labor force.
		Labor force participation rate (LFPR) = (Civilian labor force/Civilian non-institutional population)
The LFPR may sound like employment rate, but it is different. Although the denominator in both formulas is the same, the numerator in the employment rate is the number of employed persons, and the numerator in the LFPR is the civilian labor force ( which includes both employed persons and unemployed persons). For this reason, some economists say that although the employment rate gives us the percentage of the population that is working, the LFPR gives us the percentage of population that is willing to work.

Common Misconceptions About the Unemployment and Employment Rates
	Many people mistakenly think that if the unemployment rate is, say, 7 percent, the employment rate must be 93 percent. Their assumption is that the unemployment rate plus the employment rate must equal 100 percent. But the unemployment and employment rates do not add up to 100 percent, because the denominator of the unemployment rate is not the same as the denominator of the employment rate. The unemployment rate is a percentage of the civilian labor force. The employment rate is a percentage of the civilian non-institutional population, which is a larger number than the civilian labor force

6.2d
Reasons for Unemployment
- Job loser. was employed, fired or laid off
- Job leaver. quit the job
- Reentrant. Previously employed, hasn't worked for some time and is reentering the labor force
- New entrant. Never held a full time job for two weeks or longer and is now looking for a job

6.2e
Discouraged Workers
	Adam is fired from job at company A, and he looks for a job for about six months. During this time, he is considered an unemployed person and is counted in the unemployment rate. At the end of six months, Adam is very discouraged; he stops looking for a job and is now considered discouraged worker not counted in the unemployment rate

6.2f
Types of unemployment
- Frictional unemployment. Firm A and Firm B produce computers. Firm B demand rises and Firm A demand falls. Firm A fires people off while firm B hires more people. Workers at Firm A have transferable skills and can transfer to firm B. During this transitional period they are frictionally unemployed
- Structural unemployment. Changes in the economy that eliminate some jobs and create new jobs for others. people fired have no transferable skills and are said to be structurally unemployed. think automation of a car plant that creates jobs for robotics engineers but lays of mechanics.
Natural unemployment
	Adding together the frictional and structural unemployment rate gives the natural unemployment rate.
	NUR = FUR+ SUR

6.2g
The natural unemployment rate and full employment
	What is full employment?
		Full employment is the condition that exists when the unemployment rate is equal to the natural unemployment rate
	For example if the natural unemployment rate is 5%, then full employment exists when the unemployment rate is 5%.
	The economy can be operating at full employment, and some people will be unemployed

6.2h
Cyclical Unemployment
	The unemployment rate in the economy is not always the natural rate. The difference between the existing unemployment rate and the natural unemployment rate is the cyclical unemployment rate
	CUR = UR - NUR
		When the existing unemployment rate is greater than the natural unemployment rate, the cyclical unemployment rate is positive.
		When the unemployment rate (UR) is less than the natural unemployment rate (NUR) the cyclical unemployment rate (CUR) is negative.

Questions
	What is the major difference between a person who is frictionally unemployed and structurally unemployed?
		The difference is that a person who is frictionally unemployed has a transferable skill to a job that is still in demand. They still have job opportunity but are in transition to that job. A structurally unemployed person has no transferable skill and either have to retrain or reenter in a different job.
	What does positive cyclical unemployment rate imply?
		Positive cyclical unemployment rate implies that that Unemployment rate is greater than the natural unemployment rate.
	The market basket consists of 10A and 20B. The prices of A and B in the current year are $2 and $4. The prices of A and B in the base year are $1 and $2.50. What is the current-year CPI
		The current year CPI is = 166.67 = (100/60)*100
	What does the CPI in the base year equal?
		The CPI  in the base year is equal to the total market basket of the base year times the price at the time of the base year
	Show that if the percentages rise in prices is equal to the percentage rise in nominal income then ones real income does not change.
		Real income year 1 = (50,000/100) x 100 = 50,000
		Real income year 2 = (55,000/110) x 100 = 50,000
	what does it mean if the expenditure weighs of the market basket used to compute the CPI are changed?
		it means consumer expenditure has changed due to a number of practical reasons such as: change in price level due to inflation
	What is a base year?
		Base year is the consumer expenditure within the market basket at an earlier year
	In year 1, your annual income is 45000 and the CPI is 143.6; in year 2, your annual income is 51232 and the CPI 150.7. has your real income risen, fallen or remained constant?
		Real income in year 1 = (45,000/143.6) x 100 = 31,337
		Real income in year 2 = (51,232/150.7) x 100 = 33,996
		so real income has risen.
	If the cyclical unemployment is negative what does this imply?
		This implies that the Unemployment rate is less than the natural unemployment rate

Chapter summary

Measuring Prices
- A major price index is the consumer price index (CPI)
- Inflation is an increase in the price level or price index
- A given dollar amount in an earlier year does not have the same purchasing power in a later year ( or current year)
- if prices are different in the two years. To convert a dollar amount of an earlier year into todays (or current ) dollars we use the formula
	- Dollar amount earlier year x (CPI current year/CPI earlier year)

Unemployment and Employment
- An unemployed person may be a job loser, a job leaver, a reentrant or a new entrant.
- The unemployment rate may be biased downward because discouraged workers are not considered unemployed.
- Frictional unemployment, due to the natural frictions of the economy is caused by changing market conditions and is represented by qualified individuals with transferable skills who change jobs
- Structural unemployment is due to structural changes in the economy that eliminate some jobs and create other for which the unemployed are unqualified.
- Natural unemployment is caused by frictional and and structural factors in the economy. The natural unemployment rate equals the sum of the frictional unemployment rate and the structural unemployment rate.
- Full employment exists when the unemployment rate is equal to the natural unemployment rate.
- The cyclical unemployment rate is the difference between the existing unemployment rate and the natural unemployment rate
