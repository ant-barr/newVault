GDP and Real GDP

7.1
Gross Domestic Product
	GDP: the total market value of all final goods and services produced annually within a countries borders.

7.1a
Calculating GDP
	to show how GDP is computed, suppose the following data represents the prices and quantities of three goods produced in a tiny economy this year

| Goods | Quantities Produced of Each Good | Price of Each Good |
|:-----:|:--------------------------------:|:------------------:|
|   A   |                10                |         $2         |
|   B   |                20                |         $3         |
|   C   |                30                |         $5         |
	what is the GDP in this tiny economy?
		The GDP is the sum of the prices (P) of all goods times the quantities (Q) of those goods
		GDP = sum of (P x Q)
	in this case
	GDP = (2 x 10) + (3 x 20) + (5 x 30) = $230

7.1b
Final Goods and Intermediate Goods
- GDP is the total market value of final goods and services
	- Final good is the good in the hands of the final user, the ultimate consumer, it is the orange juice that the consumer buys in the store.
	- Intermediate good is an input to the production of a final good. In other words the oranges that were used to produce orange juice (the final good)
	When computing GDP, only expenditures on final goods are counted to avoid the double counting that would occur
	(double counting is counting a good more than once).

7.1c
What GDP Omits
	Some exchanges that take place in an economy are not included in GDP. These trades range form sales of used cars to illegal drug deals.
- Certain Non-market Goods and services: if a family hires a person through the classified section of the newspaper to cook and clean, the service is counted in GDP. If family members did the same task their services are not counted in the GDP
- Underground Activities, Both Legal and Illegal: Illegal goods (drugs) and others involve legal goods and tax evasion. 
- Sale of used goods, GDP measures current production (production occurring this year). A used car sale, does not enter into the current-year statistics because the was counted when it was produced.
- Final Transactions, The trading of stocks and bonds is no counted in GDP because it does not represent the production of new assets. It is simply the trading of existing assets.
- Government Transfer payments, A transfer payment is a payment to a person that is not bade in return for goods and services. Government transfer payments such as social security benefits  are not counted
- Leisure, The length of the workweek has fallen, and the leisure time has increased. Leisure is a good, but leisure is not counted in the GDP

7.1d
GDP is Not Adjusted for Bad's Generated in the production of goods
	Pollutants are a byproduct in the production of goods but does not deduct this pollution.

7.1e
Per Capita GDP
	If we divide a country's GDP by the population in the country we get per-capita GDP

7.1f
Is Either GDP or Per Capita GDP a Measure of Happiness or Wellbeing?
	It is not possible to to answer because Wellbeing and Happiness are subjective. it is possible to read too much into GDP figures.

---
7.2
The Expenditure Approach to Computing GDP for a Real-World Economy.
	It is impossible to multiply each price by each good produced to quantify it in a large economy.
The expenditure approach sum the spending in four sectors of the economy
- Household
- Business
- Government 
- Foreign
In each of these four sectors people spend, the expenditures are called
- Consumption
- Investment
- Government purchase
- Net exports

**Consumption**
- Durable goods, durable goods are goods that last for more than 3 years, ex: refrigerator, oven, car
- Nondurable goods, goods that are not expected to last more than 3 years such as food
- Services, intangible items such as lawn care, car repair, entertainment.

**Investment**
- Purchase of newly produced capital goods
- Changes in business inventories, inventory investment
- Purchases of new residential housing

**Government purchase**
	Include federal, state, and local government purchases of goods and services, such as investment in highways, bridges, etc. does NOT include Government transfer purchases.

***Net Exports***
	People, firms, and government spending on foreign produced goods are imports(IM). Foreign residents firms and governments, sometimes purchase U.S. produced goods. these are exports(EX). If imports are subtracted from exports we are left with net exports (NX)
		NX = EX - IM

---
7.2a
Computing GDP using the Expenditure Approach
	total all purchases of final goods and services made in the four sectors for the economy.
		GDP = C(consumption) + I(investment) + G(gov. purchase) + (EX - IM)

---
7.2b
Common misconceptions About Increases in GDP
	Are all increases in GDP good for the economy? Consider that if investment rises and no other component of GDP declines, GDP will rise. Recall that investments can rise for one of three reasons (1) Firms may purchase more newly produced capital goods (firms buy more factories and machines); (2) individuals may purchase new capital goods(someone buys a new home); or (3) Firms' inventory investments rises. Further, firms' inventory investments can rise in two ways:
- Planned inventory investment. Firms may deliberately produce more units of a good and add them to inventory
- Unplanned inventory investment. Consumers don't buy as many units of output as firms have produced, and unsold units are added to inventory.
Now compare two settings:
- Setting 1. Firms purchase more newly produced capital goods ( more factories and machinery). As a result, investment rises and so does GDP, all other things remain constant. (GDP rises)
- Setting 2. Buyers don't buy as many units of output as firms have produced. The unsold units find their way into (unplanned) inventory investment. As a result, the investment rises and so GDP rises too, all other things remain constant
Is the Higher GDP in settings 1 and 2 equivalent? we think not. As far as the health and strength of the economy are concerned, the increase in GDP in setting 1 is superior to the increase in GDP in setting 2

Self test
1. Describe the expenditure approach to computing GDP in a real-world economy.
	1. The expenditure approach is when the economy is divided into four sectors, Household, Business, Government, and net exports. The expenditure in these four categories are Consumption, Investments, Government Spending, and Net exports and is computed with the following equation
		1. GDP = C + I + G + (EX - IM)
2. Will GDP be smaller than the sum of consumption, investment; and government purchases if net exports are negative? 
	1. Yes the GDP will be smaller because a negative net export means there was more imports than exports that year therefore GDP will have a deduction due to the negative net exports.
3. If GDP is $400 billion and the country's population is 100 million does it follow that each individual in the country has $40,000 worth of goods and services? No, the per capita GDP is 40000 but there is no indication that that this is distributed evenly amongst the people

7.3
The Income Approach to computing GDP for a Real-World Economy.
	A second way to compute GDP, the income approach, and the expenditure approach should give us the same dollar amount of GDP. Lets look at an example.
	In a given economy, 10 units of good A are produced and 20 units of good B are produced. Further, the price of good A is $1 and the price of good B is $2. If buyers purchase all the units of each of the two goods then they will have spent $50 on these two goods: (1 x 10units) + (2 x 20units) = $50. In other words the expenditure approach to measuring GDP gives us $50 of GDP in this little economy.
		However, money spent by one person is money earned by another. The person who sells 10 units of good A at $1 makes an income of $10. the $10 spent by the buyer is $10 earned by the seller.
	The economy is equal to GDP computed by summing the income earned by the different resources. In other words, dollar purchases equal dollar income. Money spent to buy goods ends up flowing to the resources that produce them.
		Two steps are involved in computing GDP using income approach. First, compute national income. second, adjust national income for certain things. The end result is GDP.

7.3a
Computing National Income
	National income is is the sum of five components 1 compensation of employees, 2 proprietors income, 3 cooperate profits, 4 rental income of persons, and 5 net interest.
- Compensation of Employees: the compensation of employees is equal to the total of 1 wages and salaries paid to employees, 2 employers contributions to social security and employee benefit plans, and 3 the monetary value of fringe benefits, tips, and paid vacations. the compensation of employees is the largest component of national income.
- Proprietors' Income: Proprietors' income includes all forms of income earned by self-employed individuals and the owners of incorporated businesses, including unincorporated farmers. included in farm income is an estimate of the value of the food grown and consumed on farms.
- Corporate Profits: corporate profits include all the income earned by the stock holders of corporations. Some of the profits are paid to stockholders in the form dividends, some are kept within the firm to finance investments, and some are used to pay corporate profits taxes.
- Rental income: Rental income is the income received by individuals for the use of their non-monetary assets (land, houses, offices). It also includes returns to individuals who hold copyrights and patents. Finally, it includes an imputed value to owner occupied houses. For example, someone may own the house she lives in and therefore not pay rent, but for purposes of national income accounting, a rental value is imputed. In short, home ownership is viewed as a business that produces a service that is sold to the owner of the business.
- Net Interest: Net interest income received by U.S. households and government minus the interest they paid out.
- National income: we can summarize the national income and its components as it follows:
	National income = compensation of employees + proprietors' income + corporate profits + Rental income + Net interest

7.3b
From National Income to GDP: making some Adjustments
	The income approach to computing GDP requires us to add certain things to national income and to subtract certain things from it. 
		GDP = National income - Income earned from the rest of the world + income earned by the rest of the world + indirect business taxes + Capital consumption allowance + statical discrepancy
Income Earned From the Rest of the World, Income Earned by the Rest of the World
	In computing the national income we include income earned by U.S. citizens who work and live in the other countries, but we do not include the income earned by foreigners who work and live in the US
Indirect Business Taxes
	Excise taxes, sales taxes, and property taxes.
Capital Consumption Allowance
	Some capital goods are used in the production process. The cost to replace these capital goods is called Capital Consumption Allowance or Depreciation. It is added to national income because we measure all the income earned. National income doesn't include the income payments in the capita consumption allowance
Statistical Discrepancy
	GDP and national income are computed using different sets of data, some statistical discrepancies occur

---
7.3
Other National Income Accounting Measurements
	There are 5 national income accounting measurements. GDP, National income, Net domestic Product, Personal income, and Disposable income. - often used interchangeably

7.3d
Net domestic Product
	GDP minus the capital consumption allowance
		NDP = GDP - Capital Consumption allowance

7.3e
Personal Income
	The amount of income that individuals actually receive. it is equal to national income minus undistributed corporate profits, social insurance taxes and corporate profits taxes, plus transfer payments
		personal income = national income - undistributed corporate profits - social insurance taxes - corporate profits taxes + transfer payments

7.3f
Disposable income
	The portion of personal income that can be used for consumption or saving; equal t personal income minus personal taxes ( income tax)
		Disposable income = personal income - personal taxes

---
7.4
Real GDP
	The value of the entire output produced annually within a country's borders, adjusted for price changes

7.4a
Why we need real GDP
	In 2010 the US GDP was 14.75 trillion. One year later it was 15.27 trillion.  why was the GDP higher?
	suppose that 10 units of this good x are produced and each unit is sold for $10; the GDP in this economy is 100
		GDP = $10 x 10 units = $100
	The GDP rises from $100 to $250 why? it could be because price increase form 10 to 25
		GDP = $25 x 10 units = $250
	Or it could rise because the quantity of output produced increased from 10 to 25
		GDP = $10 x 25 units = $250
	Or it could rise because price increased to $12.50 and the quantity increased to 20 units:
		GDP = $12.50 x 20 units = $250
	To gauge that health of the economy, economists want to know why the GDP increased. Because an increase in GDP can be due in part simply to an increase in price, a more meaningful measure is Real GDP

7.4b
Computing Real GDP
	One way to compute Real GDP is to find the value of the output for the different years in terms of the same prices, that is, the base-year prices.

| Year | Price of Good X | Quantity Produced of Good x(units) | GDP    |
| :--: | :-------------: | :--------------------------------: | ------ |
|  1   |       $10       |                100                 | $1,000 |
|  2   |       $12       |                120                 | $1,440 |
|  3   |       $14       |                140                 | $1,960 |
The data show why GDP is higher in years 2 and 3: Both price and quantity have increased. however we want to separate the part of GDP that is higher due to an increase in quantity from the part that is higher due to an increase in price. We want the real GDP
To compute Real GDP for any year, multiply the quantity of the good produced in a given year by the price in the base year.

| Year | Price | Unit | GDP   | Real GDP         |
| ---- | ----- | ---- | ----- | ---------------- |
| 1    | $10   | 100  | $1000 | $10 x 10 = $1000 |
| 2    | $12   | 120  | $1440 | $10 x 20 = $1200 |
| 3    | $14   | 140  | $1960 | $10 x 140 = 1400 |
7.4c
The General Equation for Real GDP
	The real world has more than one good an more than one price. The general equation to compute real GDP is:
		Real GDP = sum(Base year price x Current year quantities)

7.4d
What does it Mean if Real GDP is Higher in One year Than in Another
	If GDP is 9 trillion and year 1 and 9.5 trillion in year 2, we cannot be sure why. 1 Did prices rise while output remained constant? 2. Did output rise while price remained constant?
	3. Or did prices and output both rise?
		However, if Real GDP is 8 trillion in year 1 and 8.3 trillion in year 2, we know that real GDP only rises if the output rises. Real GDP rises only if more goods and services are produced.

7.4e
Real GPD, Economic Growth, and Business cycles
	Suppose you have to chose between two countries. Country A real GDP grows by 3 percent each year. In country B, Real GDP is the same each year; which country would you prefer?
		Or make a choice between countries C and D. country C real GDP takes a roller coster ride, rising and falling, in Country D real GDP simply rises year after year.
	If you chose any real GDP matters to you.

Economic Growth: Annual economic growth has occurred if real GDP in one year is higher than Real GDP in the previous year. For example, if real GDP is 8.1 trillion in one year and 8.3 trillion in the next the economy as undergone growth

The Ups and Downs in the Economy: The Business Cycle
	If real GDP is on a roller coaster - rising and falling and rising and falling - the economy is said o be going through a business cycle. Economists usually talk about four or five phases of the business cycle. We identify five in the following list
1. Peak. At the peak of the business cycle real GDP is at a temporary high
2. Contraction. The contraction phase represents a decline in real GDP. Two consecutive quarter declines in Real GDP constitute a recession
3. Trough. The low point in Real GDP, just before it begins to turn up.
4. Recovery. The recovery is the period when Real GDP is rising. It begins at the Trough and ends at the initial peak. 
5. Expansion. The expansion phase refers to increase in Real GDP beyond the recovery

Self Test
1. Suppose that GDP is 6 Trillion in year one and 6.2 trillion in year 2. What has caused the rise in GDP?
	1. Either prices has gone up while units produced remained constant, Units produced went up while Price remained constant, or both units and price has gone up
2. Suppose Real GDP is 5.2 Trillion in year 1 and 5.3 Trillion in year 2. what has caused the rise in real GDP
	1. Price remained constant while quantity produced went up
3. Can an economy be faced with edless business cycles and still see its real GDP grow over time?
	1. Yes Real GDP can Grow over time as long as there is a greater rate of expansion than contraction

4. **Why aren****’****t stock purchases and sales counted in GDP?**
	1. stock purchases are not counted because they are not new goods only trades existing goods and servies

6. **Suppose the GDP for a country is $0. Does this mean that there was no productive activity in the country? Explain your answer.**
	1. No, this may mean that the country imported an amount of goods and services that equaled the sum of consumption, investment, government spending, and exports

8. **Identify and explain the three approaches to computing GDP.**
	1. 

10. **Describe the expenditure approach to computing GDP in a real-world economy.**
	1. An expenditure approach divides the economy into four sectors, household, business, government, net exports, with the spending (expenditure) being consumption, investments, government spending, and exports - imports.

12. **Will GDP be smaller than the sum of consumption, investment, and government purchases if net exports are negative? Explain your answer.**
	1. yes, negative net exports means that there was more importing than exports, this number is subtracted from the sum of consumption, investments, and government purchases. meaning that the GDP will be smaller.

14. **If GDP is $400 billion and the country****’****s population is 100 million, does it follow that each individual in the country has $40,000 worth of goods and services?**
	1. NO, nothing indicates that per capita gdp is distributed evenly among citizens, some people will have more, and some people will have less, it is an average.
