Says Law
	supply creates its own demand. Production creates enough demand to purchase all the goods and services produced.
The classical view
	this law is most easily understood in terms of a barter economy.
	the baker is a supplier of bread. according to say, the baker works at his trade because he plans to demand other goods. As he is baking bread, the baker is thiking of the goods and services he will exchange for it. thus, his act of supplying bread i linked to his demand for other goods.


Classical Economists on market wages, and prices
	for says law to hold in a money economy, the funds saved must give rise to an equal amount of funds invested; that is, what leaves the spending stream through one door must enter it through another door. If not, then some of the income earned form supplying goods may not be used to demand goods. As a result goods will be overproduced.
		The classical economists argued that saving is matched by an equal amount of investment because of interest rate flexibility in the credit market.
	 Saving increases -> interest rate decrease -> amount of investment increases 
Classical Economists on price and wages, both are flexible
	classical economists believed that most, if not all, markets are competitive. supply and demand operate in all markets. If, for example the labor market has a surplus, the surplus will be temporary. Soon the wage rates will decline and the quantity supplied of labor will equal the quantity demanded of it. 
		What holds for wages in the labor market holds for prices in the goods and service market. prices will adjust quickly to any surpluses or shortages, and equilibrium will quickly reestablished. 
	Classical d, prices and wages are flexible they rise and decline in response to shortages and surpluses

Three states of the economy
	 The correspondence between the labor market and three states of the economy
Real GDP and Natural Real GDP: three possibilities
- Real GDP is less than Natural real GDP
- Real GDP is greater than Natural real GDP
- Real GDP is equal to Natural Real GDP
The labor market and the three states of the economy
- Equilibrium. When the labor market is in equilibrium, the same number of jobs are available as the same number of people who want to work
- Shortage. When the labor market has a shortage more jobs are available than people who people who want to work
- Surplus. more people want to work than there are jobs available

Recessionary gap
	1 it is producing a real GDP level that is less than the natural real GDP
	2 the unemployment rate is greater than the natural unemployment rate
	A surplus exists in the labor market
Inflationary Gap
	1 it is producing a real GDP level that is greater than the natural real GDP
	2 the unemployment rate is less than the natural unemployment rate
	3 A shortage exists in the labor market

Business cycle macroeconomics and economic grown macroeconomics
	 business cycle and economic growth. business cycle deals with changes in the Real GDP around a fixed LRAS curve economic growth deals with increase in REAL GDP due to a rightward shifting LRAS curve

The institutional and physical production possibilities frontiers
- The physical PPF illustrates different combinations of goods that the economy can produce given the physical constraints of finite resources and current state of technology. the institutional PPF illustrates different combinations of goods that the economy can produce given the two physical constraints
- If an economy is operating on its institutional PPF it is operating at the natural unemployment rate. If it is operating at a point beyond the institutional PPF but below the physical PPF, it is operating at an unemployment rate less than the natural unemployment rate

the self regulating economy
- Some economists contend that the economy can eliminate both recessionary and inflationary gaps smoothly and quickly by itself
- If the economy is self-regulating and in a recessionary gap, then the unemployment rate in the economy is greater than the natural unemployment rate, and a surplus exists in the labor market. as wage contracts expire, wage rates fall, as a result the SRAS curve shifts to the right, and the price level falls. As the price level falls, the quanitty demanded of real GDP rises ultimatley the economy moves into long run equlibrium where it produces natural real GDP
- IF the economy is self regulating in an inflationary gap then the unemployment rate in the economy is less than the natural unemployment and a shortage exists in the labor market. as wage contracts expire wage rates rise. as a result, the SRAS curve shifts to the left and the price level rises. as the price level rises the quantity demanded of real GDP falls. Ultimately the economy moeves inot long-run equilibrium where it produces natrual real GDP

Explain says law in terms of a barter economy
	supply creates its own demand. the act of supplying is motivated by the desire to demand
according to classical economist, if saving rises and consumption spending falls, will total spending decrease
	no total spending will not decrease, an increase in saving will lower interrest rate and stimulate investment spending. spending on investment is equal to an increase in saving.
what is the calsical position on prices and wage
	prices and wage are flexible they move up and down in response to market conditions
What is recessionary gap and inflationary agap
	real gdp less than natrual real gdp is recessionary
	if the economy is producing a real gdp that is greater than natural real gdp its inflationary
what is the state of the labor market when the economy is in a recessionary gap?
	when the economy is in a recessionary gap, labor market has a surplus.
	when the ecoomy is in a inflationary gap labor market has a shorage
If the economy is in an inflationary gap, locate its poitoin in terms of the two ppfs
	the economy is somewhere above the institutional ppf and below the physical ppf
If the economy is self regulating what happens in a recessionary gap
	as wage contracts expire, lower wage rates, sras curve shifts rightward, price leval falls, economy moes down the ad curve, and enters long run equilibrium
what happens in an inflationary gap
	wage contracts expire, wage rates go up, sras curve shifts leftward, price level risesthe economy moes up the ad curve
	enters long run equilibrum
if the economy is self-regulating, how do changes in aggregate demadn affect the economy in the long run
	any chagnes in aggregate demand will affect only the price level, changes in AD will have no lnog run effect on real gdp.
