The Phillips Curve
	Inverse relationship between wage inflatoin and unemployment
	Measure price inflation against unemployment rates, inver relationship.
	Stagflation or high inflation and high unemployment is unlikely

Friedman natural Rate theory
- Short run and long run philips curve, short term exhibits the inflation unemployment trade off
- Friedman natural rate theory, short run, an increase in inflation is liniked to an decrease in unemployment, but in the long run, the economy returns to its natural rate of unemployment
- Adaptive expectatoins, people form inflation expectation based on past rates, other consider past and present rates as well

New Classical Theory
- individuals form their expectations rationally, wages and prices are flexible
- policy has different effects when it is unanticipated, or anticipated

New keynesian theory
- individuals form their expectations rationally, wages and prices are not completely flexible in the short run
Real business cycle theory
- real business cycle contractions originate on the supply side

Ch 17

Economic growth
- Absolute real economic growth referes to an increase in real gdp from one period to the next
- per capita economic growht referes to an increase from one period to the next in per capita real gdp

The Production Function
- A production function specifies the relation between technology and the quantity of factor inputs to output. or real gpd
- Real gdop = T (L,K)
- t (labor(L))and Physical (K) capital

The production function and economic growth
- Using the production function Real GDP = T(L<K) leads to shifts in LRAS
- changes in taxes affects the supply of labor of supply curve
- How much capital is emplooyed depends on such things as the tax treatment of capital 

New growth theory
- New growth theory, technology is endogenous; neoclassical growth theory holds that technology is exogenous, endogenous part of the economic ystem, exogenous it is not part of the system
- new ideas lead to economic growth
- institutions promote new ideas thus economic growth

Economic growht and special interest groups
- According to mancur oleson, the more special interst groups a country has, the morelikely it is that transfer promoting policies will be lobbied for insted of growth promoting policies, individuals will try to get a larger slice of a constant size economic pie rather than trying to increase the size of the pie.
