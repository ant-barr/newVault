The Texas constitution
	The Texas constitution was made at the end of the 19th century and is therefore more advanced than the US constitution. Modern constitutions are more capable to reflect the modern circumstances.
What are the difference between the state of Texas and the Republic of Texas?
	The Republic of Texas constitution preamble invokes the language of the US constitution almost verbatim while the State constitution Invokes the blessing of god and omits language about forming and protecting of a sovereign territory. The Republic of Texas is secular while the state constitution preamble references religion.
