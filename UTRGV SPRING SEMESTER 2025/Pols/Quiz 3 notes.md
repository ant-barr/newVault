Veto Power:
- The governor has the power to either approve or veto bills passed by the Texas Legislature. The Governor has line-item veto power. enabling the governor to veto individual components (or lines) of a bill. The Governor of Texas line item veto power applies only to spending measures, only to a bill that contains several items of appropriation. when a bill contains those sever items of appropriation the governor my object to one or more of such items  and approve the other portion of the bill. thus the governor may line item veto one or more items of appropriation without vetoing the entire appropriations bill.
Time to Consider
	The governor must sigh or veto legislation within 10 days of transmittal (excluding Sunday) or it becomes a law without his signature. there is no pocket veto for legislation transmitted with less than 10 days left in the session, the governor ahs 20 days after adjournment to act, or the legislation becomes law without being signed. This latter provision allows a governor to veto legislation after the legislature has adjourned with no opportunity for the legislature to override a veto in practice a governors vetoes are rarely challenged. 
Legislative Override
	Two-thirds of members present in both chambers must vote to override a veto. If all members are in attendance, this is 100 of the 150 members in the Texas House of Representatives and 21 of the 31 members in the Texas state senate. Texas is one of 36 states that require two thirds vote from both of its legislative chambers to override a veto.

Clemency Power
	Clemency includes full pardons after conviction or successful completion of a term of deferred adjudication community supervision, conditional pardons, pardons based on innocence, commutations of sentence, and reprieves. In capital cases, clemency includes commutation of sentence to life in prison and a reprieve for execution. The governor may also grant a one-time reprieve of execution, not to exceed 30 days, without a board recommendation.

---

Appointment Power
	The authority to make Governmental appointments is one of the most significant powers given to the governor of Texas by the states constitution.
	during a four year term the governor will make about 3000 appointments

most appointments are: 
1. State officials and members of state boards, commissions and councils that carry out the laws and direct the policies of state government activities;
2. Members of task forces that advice the Governor or executive agencies on specific issues and policies; or
3. state elected and judicial offices when vacancies occur by resignation or death of the office holder.

Budgetary Power
	The governor has relatively limited budgetary powers. The governor is required to submit an executive budget, but the Legislature typically ignores the Governor's budget, preferring to take the lead itself on budgetary matters
	A Governor may attempt to influence the budgetary process through the power persuasions, but this power is limited.
	in the end, a governors primary budget power is the power to veto or threaten to veto legislation.

Roles played by the Legislative and Executive Branches

The executive and legislative branches of government play an interesting tug-of-war with public policy in Texas in a slightly different way than in the federal government. The Texas legislature has much more initial control of the budget process than the governor. The legislative budget board, in which the governor plays no part, is an entirely legislative agency, and prepares the states draft budget under the direction of legislative leaders. This legislature-driven budget, however, starts from a number generated by a different member of the executive branch - the comptroller of public Accounts.

The Comptrollers BRE (biennial revenue estimate) is the initial estimate of what the states total revenue will be over the two-year budget cycle and is a preview of the number the comptroller will use at the end of the legislative session to certify the budget. Without certification by the comptroller, the state budget cannot take effect, and legislators would be required to start over. At the end of the session, however, the governor's office experiences a power surge seen in no other state. A governor can veto most bills after the legislature has finally adjourned, removing the threat of an override. The governor also has line-item veto authority allowing him to veto individual spending items.

while the legislature has the sole power to make laws in Texas, executive branch agencies have significant latitude to interpret state statutes through agency rulemaking. Legislators, aware and somewhat wary of this, require a special statement attached to the official analysis of every bill considered on the floor of the house or senate disclosing whether the bill delegates any rulemaking authority to any state official or agency.

The Texas attorney general also brings some interpretive power to the equation. with the power to issue a formal attorney general opinion this official can sometimes make public policy decisions separately from the legislature, and without the judicial branch. an attorney generals opinion in Texas has the force of law until a court rules otherwise, or the legislature changes the law on which the opinions based.

The Informal Powers of the Executive Branch

In addition to the formal powers of the governor and other executive branch officials, a smart governor can accomplish a lot using informal powers. Governor George W. Bush was legendary for his ability to forge genuine friendships with other state officials - notably House Speaker Pete Laney and Lieutenant Governor Bob Bullock. The three had breakfast at the Governors Mansion weekly during legislative sessions. When he announced his candidacy for the Republican nomination for President in 1999, Speaker Laney, a Democrat, introduced him. Friendly late night meetings over beer or two helped governor bush and some of his staunchest political opponents find common ground on a variety of policy issues. 

The Texas governor has the highest profile role of any state official and can use that to his advantage. An endorsement form the governor can mean a lot in a race for the state house or senate, and a grateful legislator should be eager to return the favor. conversely, Governor Greg abbot actively worked against the reelection of two legislators from his own party in 2018 helping to defeat one. 

The governors appointment power to appoint members to boards, commissions, councils, and committees can provide the governor with significant informal power over policy in many key areas. The executive branch of the Texas government is made up of over 400 state boards, commissions, and agencies. finally, the governors unilateral post session veto power creates a lot of informal leverage during during the legislative session. A legislative bill author asked by the governor to support a change to his bill - even a drastic one - has little alternative, knowing the bill can be vetoed with no opportunity for an override vote.

Texas' Plural Executive

Article 4 of the Texas Constitution describes the executive department of Texas. Texas utilizes a plural executive which means the power of the Governor is limited and distributed amongst other government officials.
