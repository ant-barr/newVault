Aggregate Demand and Aggregate Supply

8.1
A Way to View the Economy
	This chapter begins our theoretical discussion of an economy. We can think of the economy in two activities, Buying and Selling. 

8.2
Aggregate Demand
	Aggregate Demand: the quantity demanded of all goods and services (Real GDP) at different price levels, cetris paribus.

| Price index | Quantity demanded of goods and services (Quantity demanded of Real GDP) |
|:-----------:|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------:|
|     100     |               $1,200 Billion worth of goods and services                |
|     110     |                $1000 Billion worth of goods and services                |
|     120     |                $800 Billion worth of goods and services                 |
An aggregate demand (AD) curve is the graph of aggregate demand. The gurve is downward sloping, indicating an inverse relationship between the price level (P) and quantity demanded of Real GDP (Q): As the price level rises, the quantity demanded of Real GDP falls; as the price level falls, the quantity demanded of Real GDP rises.

8.2a
Why Does the Aggregate Demand Curve Slope Downward?
	This inverse relationship and the downward slope of AD curve are explained by (1) the real balance effect, (2) the interest rate effect, and (3) the internal trade effect.
Real Balance Effect (Due to a change in the price level)
- Real balance effect states that the inverse relationship between price level and the quantity demanded of Real GDP is established through changes in the value of monetary wealth or value of a persons assets
- Changes in the monetary wealth usually take form of increased or decreased purchasing power
- Purchasing power: the quantity of goods and services that can be purchased with a unit of money. Purchasing power and the price level are inversely related. As the price level goes up(down) purchasing power goes down(up)

Interest Rate Effect ( due to change in price level)
	The interest rate effect states that the inverse relationship between the price level and the quantity demanded of Real GDP is established through changes in the part of household and business spending that is sensitive to changes in interest rates
		A person buy fixed bundle of goods( food, clothing, shelter) each week. Suppose the price level falls, increasing the purchasing power of the persons money. they can buy the fixed bundle of goods with less money.
		if the price level goes up they cannot purchase the fixed bundle with the same money, so they need to acquire more money

International Trade Effect ( due to a change in the price level)
	International Trade Effect: the change in foreign sector spending as the price level changes
		The inverse relationship between the price level and quantity demanded of Real GDP is established through foreign sector spending, which includes U.S. spending on foreign goods (imports) and foreign spending on US goods ( exports) 
	When the price level of American goods fall, Americans and foreigners buy more US goods.
		If the price level rises US goods become more expensive than foreign goods and both Americans and foreigners buy fewer us goods

8.2b
An Important Word on the Three Effects
	when we say the interest rate effect, we are talking about the interest rate effect of a change in the price level
		Price level changes -> interest rate effect
	The interest rate can change due to things other than the price level. and not everything that changes the interest rate lead to a movement form one point to another on the AD curve. Other things that change the interest rate can lead to a shift in the AD curve

8.2c
A change in the quantity demanded of real GDP versus a change in Aggregate Demanded
	As the price level falls the quantity demanded of Real GDP rises.
Real Balance effect
- Price level falls -> purchasing power rises -> monetary wealth rises -> buy more goods
- Price level rises -> purchasing power falls -> monetary wealth falls -> buy fewer goods
Interest Rate Effect
- price level falls -> purchasing power rises -> less money to buy fixed goods -> save more -> supply of credit rises -> interest rate falls -> business and households borrow more at lower interest rate -> buy more goods
- Price level rises -> purchasing power falls -> borrow money in order to continue to buy fixed bundle of goods -> demand for credit rises -> interest rate rises -> business and households borrow less at higher interest rate -> buy fewer goods.
International Trade Effect
- Price level in US falls relative to foreign price levels -> US goods relatively less expensive than foreign goods -> both Americans and foreigners buy more US goods
- Price level in US rises -> US goods more expensive (than foreign goods) -> both Americans and foreigners buy fewer US goods.

8.2d
Changes in aggregate demand shifts in the AD curve
	What can change aggregate demand? What can cause aggregate demand to rise and fall
		The simple answer is that aggregate demand changes when spending on US goods and services change. IF spending increases  at a given price level aggregate demand rises and falls when spending decreases at a price level
	Spending increase at price level -> AD rises
	Spending decreases at price level -> AD falls
When US and foreign people, firms, and government want to buy 7.0 Trillion worth of goods, and something changes and now its 7.5 trillion, The price level has not changed. however, aggregate demand has increased. as a result the AD curve shifts to the right.

8.2e
How spending components affect Aggregate Demand
	to calculate the total expenditures on us goods and services, we use the sum of the four major spending components
		Total expenditure on us goods/services = C + I + G + NX
	This dollar amount will go up if (1) C rises (2) I rises, (3) G rises, and or (4) NX rises.
	the dollar amount will go down if spending in those sectors fall.
- Consumption, Investment, Government purchase, or net exports rise, aggregate demand will rise and AD curve will shift to the right
- If Consumption, investment, government purchase, or net exports fall, aggregate demand will fall, and the AD curve will shift to the right

8.2f
Why is there more total spending?
	True or false? The price level falls and the total spending rises. As a result of total spending rising, aggregate demand in the economy rises, and the AD curve shifts rightward
		You may think the answer is true - perhaps because you are accustomed to thinking that if total spending rises, aggregate demand rises. But aggregate demand rises ONLY if total spending rises at a given price level
	To illustrate the difference between (1) total spending rising at a falling price level and (2) total spending rising at a given price level, consider the example:
		(1)The price level falls, and goods and services become cheaper. As a result of lower prices, individuals start to buy more goods and services, As a result, total spending rises.
		(2) The price level does not change. still, something in the economy changes so that people start buying more goods and services. As a result of their buying more goods and services, total spending in the economy rises.
	In both cases  total spending rises. but example one total spending rises because prices have fallen. this leads to a movement down a given AD curve. in example 2 total spending rises even when prices remain unchanged. This leads to a shift rightward in the AD curve.
		total spending can rise for one of two reasons. but only one shifts the AD curve, when the price level stays the same.

Factors that can change C, I, G, and NX(EX-IM) and therefore Can change AD(Shift the AD curve)

Due to ==consumption==
- wealth
- price
- income
- interest rate
- income tax

**Factors that change aggregate demand and consumptions due to ===wealth===***
- wealth increases, consumption increases, aggregate demand increases
- wealth decreases, consumption decreases, aggregate demand decreases
**Factors that change Aggregate Demand and Consumption due to ===Prices===**
- Expect higher future prices consumption goes up and aggregate demand increases
- Expect lower future prices consumption goes down and aggregate demand decreases
**Factors that change Aggregate Demand and Consumption due to ===Income===**
- Expect Higher future income, consumption goes up, demand goes up
- Expect Lower future income, consumption goes down, aggregate demand goes down
**Factors that change Aggregate Demand and consumption due to ===interest rate===**
- Interest rate goes up, consumption goes down ,aggregate demand goes down
- interest rates goes down, consumption goes up, aggregate demand goes up
**Factors that change Aggregate Demand and Consumption due to ===Income Taxes===
- Income taxes goes up consumption goes down aggregate demand goes down
- Income taxes goes down consumption goes up aggregate demand goes up

Factors that change aggregate demand
	due to ===investment===: GDP= C+ ===I ===+ G + (X-M)
- interset rates
- future sales
- business taxes

***Factors that change aggregate demand and investment due to ===interest rates===***
- Interest rates increase, investments decrease, aggregate demand decreases
- Interest rates decrease, investments increase, aggregate demand increases
***Factors that change aggregate demand and investments/ ===future sales===***
- Optimistic about future sales, investments increase, aggregate demand increases
- Pessimistic about future sales, investments decrease, aggregate demand decreases
***Factors that change investment/expectations about ===future sales===***
	Businesses invest because they expect to sell the goods they produce
- optimistic, investments increase, aggregate demand increase
- pessimistic, investments decrease aggregate demand decrease
	if businesses become optimistic about future sales, , investment spending grows and aggregate demand increases.
	if businesses become pessimistic about future sales investment spending contracts and aggregate demand decreases
***Factors that change aggregate demand and investment/ ===business taxes***
- business taxes goes down, investment increases, aggregate demand increases
- business taxes goes up, investment contracts, aggregate demand decreases
***Factors that change investments/business taxes***
	businesses naturally consider expected after-tax profits when making their investment decisions
- business taxes increase, investments contracts, aggregate demand decreases
- business taxes decrease, investments increase, aggregate demand increases
	An increase in business taxes lowers expected profitability. with less profit expected, businesses invest less. as investment spending declines so does aggregate demand.
	a decrease in business taxes on the other hand raises expected probability and investments spending this increases aggregate demand.

Short-Run aggregate supply 
- ===Aggregate Supply=== - the quantity supplied of all goods and services (real GDP) at different price levels, certeris paribus
- ===Short run Aggregate Supply (SRAS) Curve ===- a curve that shows the quantity supplied of all goods and services (real GDP )at different price levels, ceteris paribus.
Short-Run Aggregate Supply Curve
	the short-run aggregate supply curve (SRAS) is upward - sloping, specifying a direct relationship between the price level and the quantity supplied of real GDP

---
Why does the Short run Aggregate Supply Curve Slope Upward?
	Two possible explanations:
	- Sticky wages
	- Worker misconceptions

Sticky Wages, the Real Wage Rate, and SRAS
- ===Wages are "locked in" for a few years due to labor contracts or perhaps because of social conventions or perceived notions of fairness===
- While firms pay nominal wages (less value) they often decide how many workers to hire based on real wages (adjusted for inflation)

Sticky Wages and the Real Wage Rate - Workers
- The Real wage = Nominal wage/Price level.
- Price level goes up real wages goes down, ceteris paribus
- Price level decrease real wages goes up, ceteris paribus
- More individuals are willing to work, and current workers are willing to work more at higher real wages than at lower real wages and vice versa.
Real wage Goes up -> Quantity supplied of labor Increases.
Real wag goes down -> Quantity of labor supplied Decrease.

Sticky Wages and the Real Wage rate - Firms
- ===Firms will employ more workers the cheaper it is to hire them.===
- Real wages goes up -> Quantity of labor demanded Decrease
- Real wages goes down -> Quantity of labor demanded Increases.
	Thus. if wages are sticky, an increase in the price level (which pushes real wages down) will result in a increase in output. This is what an upward-sloping SRAS curve represents. As the price level rises, the quantity supplied of goods and services rises. The opposite occurs if price levels fall

---
Worker Misconceptions
- If ==workers === ===misperceive=== ===real wages changes=== then a ==fall in the price level=== will bring about a ===decline in output===, cetreris paribus, which is illustrative of an ===upward-sloping SRAS curve===
- In response to (the misperceived) falling real wage, ===workers may reduce the quantity of labor they are willing to supply. ===With fewer workers (resources), ===firms will end up producing less.===

---
Changes in SRAS
	Shifts in the SRAS curve may be caused by changes in:
- Wage rates
- Prices of non-labor inputs
- Productivity
- Supply shocks
	- Adverse
	- Beneficial

===Changes in Wage Rates===
- The impact of a rise or fall in equilibrium wage rates can be understood in terms of the following equation: Profit per unit = Price per unit - Cost per unit
	- Higher wage rates means higher costs and a reduction in the number of units ( of a given good) that firms will want to produce.
	- Lower wage rates mean lower costs and, at constant prices, translate into higher profits and an increase in the number of units( of a given good) firms will decide to produce.

===Changes in the Price of Non-labor Inputs===
	Changs in the prices of non-labor inputs affect the SRAS curve in the same way as changes in wage rates do.
		An increase in the price of a non-labor input(e.g., oil, raw materials) Shifts the SRAS curve leftward; a decrease in their price shifts the SRAS curve rightward.

Changes in the Productivity
- ***Productivity*** is the output produced per unit of input employed over some period of time. Although various inputs can become more productive, let's consider the labor input
	- An ***increase*** in labor productivity means businesses will produce more output with the same amount of labor, causing the SRAS curve to shift rightward.
	- A ***decrease*** in labor productivity means businesses will produce less output with the same amount of labor, causing the SRAS curve to shift leftward.
	- A host of factors lead to increased labor productivity, including a more educated labor force, a larger stock of capital goods, and technological advancements
---
Supply Shocks
	Major natural or institutional changes that affect aggregate supply are referred to as supply shocks. Supply shocks are two varieties.
- Adverse supply shocks shifts the SRAS curve leftward.
- Beneficial supply shocks shift the SRAS curve rightward
	- Hurricane Milton causing a disrupt in the production of IV fluid for hospitals

Short-run Equilibrium
- At P1, the quantity supplied of Real GDP is greater than the quantity demanded. As a result, the price level falls and firms decrease output.
- At P2, the quantity demanded of Real GDP is greater than the quantity supplied. As a result, the price level rises and firms increase output.
- Short-run equilibrium occurs at point E, where the quantity demanded of Real GDP equals the (short-run) quantity supplied.

---
Natural Real GDP and Natural Unemployment
- The Real GDP that is produced at the natural unemployment rate
- The Real GDP that is produced when the economy is in long-run equilibrium.
	- Unemployment caused by frictional and structural factors in the economy

Long-Run aggregate Supply (LRAS)Curve
- The LRAS curve is a vertical line at the level of Natural Real GDP.
- It represents the output the economy produces when all economy wide adjustments have taken place and workers do not have any relevant misperceptions.

---
Equilibrium States of the Economy.
	During the time an economy moves from on equilibrium to another it is said to be in disequilibrium.

Short run Equilibrium
- The condition that exists in the economy when the quantity demanded of Real GDP equals the (short-run) quantity supplied of Real GDP.
- This condition is met where the aggregate demand curve intersects the short-run aggregate supply curve.

Long-run Equilibrium
- The condition that exists in the economy when wages and prices have adjusted to their (final) equilibrium levels and workers do not have any relevant misperceptions 
- Graphical, long run equilibrium occur at the intersection of the AD and LRAS curves.

Three States of an Economy
	An economy can be in short-run equilibrium, long-run equilibrium, or disequilibrium.
- When the economy is in neither short -run nor long-run equilibrium, it is said to be in disequilibrium
- Essentially, disequilibrium is the state of the economy as it moves from one short run equilibrium to another or from short-run equilibrium to long-run equilibrium.
- In disequilibrium, the quantity supplied an the quantity demanded of Real GDP are not equal.

Explain the real Balance Effect
	Real balance effect a rise in the price level causes purchasing power to fall which decreases a persons monetary wealth. As people become less wealth, the quantity demanded of Real GDP falls.
Explain what happens to the AD curve if the dollar appreciates relative to other currencies
	If the dollar appreciates, it takes more foreign currency to buy a dollar and fewer dollars to buy foreign currency. This makes US goods more expensive for foreigners and foreign goods cheaper for americans. in turn foreigners buy less american exports and americans buy more foreign imports. As exports fall and imports rise, net exports fall and total expenditures fall. as total expenditures fall the AD curve shifts to the left.
If wage rates decline, explain what happens to the short-run aggregate supply
	As wage rates decline the cost per unit of production fall. in the short run, profit per unit rises, Higher profit causes producers to produce more units of their good, the SRAS curve shifts to the right
Give an Example of an increase in labor productivity
	Last year, 10 workers produced 100 units of good x in 1 hour. this year 10 workers produced 120 units of good x on 1 hour
The details of the worker misperceptions explanation for the upward sloping SRAS curve.
	Workers initially misperceive the change in their real wage due to a change in the price level. suppose the nominal wage is 30 and the price level is 1.50; it follows that the real wage is 20. Now suppose the nominal wage falls to $25 and the price level falls to 1.10. The real wage is now 22.72 but suppose workers misperceive the decline in the price level and mistakenly believe it has fallen to 1.40 they will now perceive their real wage as 17.85 in other words, they will misperceive their real wage as falling when it has actually increase. How will workers react if they believe their real wage has fallen? they will cut back on the quality supplied of labor, which will end p reducing output ( or Real GDP) this process is consistent with an upward-sloping SRAS curve. A decline in the price level leads to a reduction in output
What is the difference between short-run equilibrium and long run equilibrium
	in long run equilibrium, the economy is producing natural real GDP in short run equilibrium, the economy is not producing natural real GDP, although the quantity demanded of real GDP equals the quantity supplied of real GDP
