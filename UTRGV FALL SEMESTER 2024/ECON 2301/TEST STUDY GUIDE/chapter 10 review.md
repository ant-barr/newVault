Keynes's criticism of says law in a money economy
	A decrease in consumption and an increase in saving may not always be equivalent, thus total expenditure might be different
		suppose investment only goes up 40 from a saving of 100 so total investment rises by 40
Classical view
- saving is directly related to the interest rate
- As the interest rate goes up, saving rises, and the interest rates goes down, saving falls, ceteris paribus
Keynesian view
- Important factors determining investment
	- interest rates
	- expected rate of profit on profit
	- expectations about investment returning
	If business expectations are pessimistic then investment is unlikely regardless of how low the interest rate is

Keynesian economics
		 employees and labor unions will resists an employers efforts to cunt wages
	wage and price rates may be inflexible downward
		recessionary gap do not close on its own
		the economy does not self regulate
		example: great recession
		the economy requires direct government intervention through fiscal policy

Classical economists
	Employers will cut wages
	wages and prices are flexible
	recessionary gaps naturally adjust
	unemployment naturally reaches normal rates
	the economy can self regulate

Efficiency wage models: 
it is the best interrest of biusiness frims to pay their employees wage rate that are higher than equilibrium wage rate
	wage rates might be inflexible downward
	if they are inflexible then self regulating property of the economy are in question

How long does it take for wage rate and price to fall
	today, many take a position between keynes's and that of classical economics
		the question is not whether wages and price are flexible but how long it take for them to adjust downward

Consumption function: the relationship between consumption and disposable income
	C = C(0) + (MPC)(Y(d))
	where MPC is the marginal propensity to consume: the ration of the change in consumption to the change in disposible income = MPC = delta C / delta Y(d)
	C is autonomous ocnsumption, MPC is the marginal propensity to consume y is disposable income
The multiplier
- A change in autonomous spending will bring about multiple change in total spending. the overall change in spending is equal to the multiplier [1/(1 - MPC)] times the change in autonomous spending

What do keynesians mean when they say the economy is inherently unstable?
	the economy may not self regulate at natural real GDP
	instead an economy can get stuck in a recessionary gap. to say that economy is self regulating is the same as saying prices and wages are flexible and adjust quickly. they are just two ways of describing the same thing
According to keynes why might aggregate demand be too low
	the main reason is that says law may not hold in a money economy. the quastion is why doesnt it. keynes argued that an increase in saving does not biring about an equal amount of additional investments because neither saving nor investment is exclusivly affected by changes in the interest rate.
How is autonomous consumption differnt from consumption
	autonomous consumption is one fo the conmponents of overall consumption. the part of overall consumption C is that autonomous is C(0) this part of consumption does not depend on disposable income. that part of consumption that does depend on disposable income is the MPC for example assume the MPC = .80 if Y rises by 100 then consumtion goes up by 800.
If the MPC = .70 what does the multiplier equal
	1/(1-0.70) = 1/0.30 = 3.33.
What happens to the multiplyer as the MPC falls
	The multiplier falls. for example if MPC = .20 then the multiplier is 1.25 but if MPC = 0.80 then the multiplier is 5
what was keynes position with respect to the self regulating properties of the economy
	keynes believed that the economy may not always self regulate. people are not always capable of generating enough aggregate demand in the economy so that the economy equilibriates at natural real gdp.
what will happen to real GDP if autonomous spending rises and the economy operating at the horizontal section of keysians AS curve
	the increase in autonomous spending will lead to greater increase in total spending and a shift in th AD curve. if the if the economy is operating in the horizontal sectoin of the keysian as curve, real gdp will rise, and here will be no change in price
an economist who believes the economy is self regulating is more likey to advocat laissez fair than an economist who belives the economy is inherently unstable agree or disagree. 
	Agree
What happens in the economy if total production is greater than total expendature
	busniess inventories rise above optimal levels. in reaction firms cut bakc on their production of goods and services. leads to a decline in real gdp which stops falling when tp eqauls te
what happens in the economy if total expenditures are greater than total production 
	when TE is greater than TP households and businesses want to buy more than firms are producing and offering. business inventories fall below optimal levels, in reaction, firms increase their production of goods and services. this leads to a rise in real gdp, which stops rising when TP equal TE
